# Getting Involved Form

In order to increase volunteer participation and involvement with AUREA, the Volunteer Management Team conducted a survey to gather information on experiences of aro-spec folks who may potentially want to get involved or are already involved. The findings will be used to signal strengths and problem areas and advise what actions the Volunteer Management Team has to take in order to best serve current volunteers as well as improve recruitment.

Most common barriers are:

- Concerns about suitability (e.g., perceived lack of skills)
- Time constraints
- Not knowing where/how to get involved
- Feeling nervous, anxious, or unsure about getting involved

Elaborations:

- People are confused or unsure about getting involved
- Still closeted
- Worried about limited energy/time

Most favored benefits:

- Contact with fellow aros
- Flexible work environment
- Gaining professional connections and experience

Elaborations on what AUREA can do to help:

- Clearer instructions/expectations/descriptions and sharing more info on experience of volunteering
- More accessible
- Make it better know that AUREA is recruiting volunteers (some didnâ€™t know that it was even possible) 

## Actions
- Get testimonies from current volunteers to give an idea of what it's liked to volunteer with us
- Add the time commitments onto the volunteer description page
- Make it clear that is all online and that people can do things anonymously
- Find a way to graphically present the volunteer experience (video or draw my life or infographic/comic)
- More actively campaign with our volunteer positions (arocalypse/activism discord + our usual social media platforms) 
- Host a live Q&A session on youtube: people send in their questions ahead of time for us to answer and then allow people in the chat to ask questions - put a poll; getting input from current volunteers
- Add list of available accommodations to make it more accessible
